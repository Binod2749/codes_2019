                                                        Pyhon Basics
                                                    ==================
													
==> Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.



==>Why do we nedd to Python?

Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. 
You do not need to compile your program before executing it.

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and 
interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented − 
Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.





python primary Synatax:- 

Interactive Mode Programming  : when you simply run the code in interpreter with passing parameter.
print("Hello new developer , welcome")



Script Mode Programming:  create a python file test.py and put print("Hello new developer , welcome")
python test.py 

Output will be same in both case as above.

###lets have one more way to call a python script ######
modify file test.py 

#!/usr/bin/python
 print("Hello new developer , welcome")
 
 
Now you just need to execute the file , As test.py . it will display your output.





                 #####################Python Identifiers####################
                 idntifier means name to identify python class, function , varible etc.
                 python is case sensative language, it discriminate the lower and upper cases.
                 
                 
                 
                 ###########################Indentation#####################
                 Python provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or code flow controlling. 
                 Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is hardcoded rule of pyhton.
                 
                 
                 Multi-Line Statements : allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to represnt that the line is continuing.
                 
                 eg :-  Man = he should be honest + \
                              ,dedicated ,hardwarking.
                              
                              Note : above line is in same line
                              



####Python has five standard data types ####  
1.Numbers
2.String 
3.List       ==>  [] , collection ,{ordered,changable,AD}, AD==> all0w duplicates
4.Tuple      ==>  () , collection ,{ordered,UNchangable,AD} 
5.Dictionary ==>  {} , collection ,{UNORDERD,Changable,No Duplicacy}
6.set        ==>     , UNORDERED,UNIndexed ,No Duplicacy

Example :- 
1.Numbers    ==>  var1 = 1
2.String     ==>  str = 'Binod'
3.List       ==> list = ['Binod',1201127,'Bokaro','Jharkhand'] 
4.Tuple      ==>  ('Binod',1201127,'Bokaro','Jharkhand') 
5.Dictionary ==>  {'NAME': 'Binod', 'CITY': 'Bokaro' , 'STATE': 'Jharkhand'}

###############Decision Making############## 

1.if statement
2.if..else statements
3.nested if statements
4.if-elif ladder


++++++++++++++++++
1 .IF Statement :- 
++++++++++++++++++

i = 10
if (i > 5):  #### Whenever condition satisfy above value then only it Execute below command else it will exit
    print("10 is greater than 5")


Output :- 10 is greater than 5




++++++++++++++++++
2.IF else Statement :- 
++++++++++++++++++

i = 20;
if (i < 15): #### Whenever condition satisfy above value then only it Execute below command else it will go to else block
    print("i is smaller than 15")
    print("i'm in if Block")

else:
    print(i,"is greater than 15")
    print("i'm in else Block")
    
    
    
 ++++++++++++++++++
3.Nested-if Statement :- 
+++++++++++++++++++ 
We can place an if statement inside another if statement.
